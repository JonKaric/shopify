There are currently 2 fieldtypes that have been included with this addon - **Variants** and **Disabled Input**. These are both selectable in the blueprints UI.

## Variants

This pulls through all variants based on the current product. It allows for a stack to be opened which the user can then edit the variant details. 

<alert type="info">

This is exclusive to the products and will only work with them.

</alert>

## Disabled Input

This allows for a disabled text input to be viewable in the editor. This will allow you to display various data elements but not let the user edit them. This is useful for information such as variant stock, price, etc.
